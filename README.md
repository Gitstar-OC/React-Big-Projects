# Big React Projects

- [1. Little Lemon](#little-lemon)
- [2. Theme Verse](#theme-verse) 

**_These are some huge projects that I have created (No one is full-stack currently) . These projects encompass all the React concepts that I have mentioned in [React Notes](https://github.com/Gitstar-OC/React-Notes). The code for these projects is stored in separate repositories so I can update them as needed. You can also make pull requests if you want to contribute, and I will review your changes._**

- ### 1. [Little Lemon Coursera](https://github.com/Gitstar-OC/Little-Lemon-Coursera)
  > <details> The Capstone project at the center of this course is based on a scenario involving the restaurant Little Lemon. In particular, the owners of Little Lemon have received negative feedback on the reserve a table function on the Little Lemon website. Users are confused about how to use it and unhappy with how it looks and functions. I had build a responsive web app and demonstrate multiple skills by coding a modern front end application that allows users to reserve a table for the Little Lemon restaurant. </details>

  > <details> This is a platform that offers customizable themes for the primary sections of your homepage, tailored to your preferences. Various leading technologies are used in this project with some css libraries like Tailwind and Bootstrap, JavaScript libraries like React and Chakra UI. I will be adding a page that will be used to show the websites that I have built from a figma file and add a path to it. </details>
